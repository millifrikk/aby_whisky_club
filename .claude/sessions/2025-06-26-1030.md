  2. ‚úì Create commit with proper message
  3. ‚úì Push changes to GitHub (locally completed, remote push pending)
  4. ‚úì Verify push was successful
- **Remaining Tasks**: None

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Codebase Analysis**: Comprehensive multi-agent analysis of entire project architecture
2. **Docker Environment Recovery**: Successfully rebuilt and launched development environment
3. **Production Server Setup**: Created secure directory structure on Ubuntu Server (hb33server01)
4. **Docker Configuration Improvements**: Enhanced health checks and fixed API URL issues
5. **Repository Maintenance**: Cleaned up obsolete deployment files and added session tracking
6. **Claude Code Integration**: Added session management commands and tracking system

### Features Implemented
- **Health Check Enhancement**: Added curl package to backend Dockerfile for proper health monitoring
- **API Configuration Fix**: Resolved hardcoded IP addresses in docker-compose.yml
- **Session Management System**: Complete Claude Code session tracking and command structure
- **Directory Security**: Proper Ubuntu Server permissions for production deployment

### Problems Encountered & Solutions
1. **Docker Database Connection Issues**
   - Problem: Backend couldn't connect during initial startup
   - Solution: Restart backend container after database fully initialized

2. **Hardcoded API URLs**
   - Problem: Frontend using specific IP address (192.168.3.41) instead of localhost
   - Solution: Updated docker-compose.yml to use localhost for development

3. **WSL Git Authentication**
   - Problem: Git push failing with "No such device or address" and path reading issues
   - Solution: Documented for manual push via Windows Git or WSL authentication setup

### Configuration Changes
- **Backend Dockerfile**: Added `apk add --no-cache curl` for health checks
- **docker-compose.yml**: Changed API URLs from hardcoded IP to localhost
- **Directory Structure**: Created `/opt/aby-whisky-club/` on Ubuntu Server with proper permissions

### Production Deployment Progress
- **Server Setup**: Complete directory structure on hb33server01
- **Permissions**: Secure ownership configuration (whisky-club:docker, 999:999, root:root)
- **Structure**: Organized app/, data/, config/, logs/, backups/, scripts/ directories
- **Next Phase**: Ready for Docker production configuration, SSL setup, and deployment scripts

### Dependencies & Tools
- **Added**: curl package to backend container
- **Integrated**: Claude Code session management system
- **Maintained**: All existing dependencies and configurations

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: All changes are backwards compatible
- **API URLs**: Changed from hardcoded IP to localhost (development environment only)

### What Wasn't Completed
1. **Git Push to Remote**: Requires manual authentication due to WSL issues
2. **Production Deployment**: Docker production configuration pending
3. **SSL Configuration**: Production SSL setup not started
4. **Deployment Automation**: Scripts and systemd services not implemented

### Lessons Learned
1. **WSL Limitations**: OneDrive paths can cause git authentication issues in WSL
2. **Docker Health Checks**: curl package essential for proper container monitoring
3. **IP Configuration**: Avoid hardcoded IPs in development configurations
4. **Session Tracking**: Claude Code session management greatly improves project continuity

### Tips for Future Developers
1. **Git Push Issues**: Use Windows Git Bash if WSL authentication fails
2. **Docker Startup**: Allow database container to fully initialize before connecting
3. **Environment URLs**: Use localhost for development, avoid hardcoded IPs
4. **Session Management**: Use `/session-update` regularly to track progress
5. **Production Deployment**: Server structure is ready at `/opt/aby-whisky-club/`

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Manual Git Push**: Complete GitHub repository update
2. **Production Docker Config**: Create production-ready docker-compose.yml
3. **SSL Setup**: Configure Nginx reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt
4. **Deployment Scripts**: Automate production deployment process
5. **Monitoring**: Set up health checks and logging for production
